# Prime-Minister-Memory-Card-Game
A game to test ones memory by having a set of cards with a bunch of images (Canadian prime ministers). The user can click a card to flip it over, and then click another card to see if it matches.
The game is commenced when the program is ran, and it is finished either when all the
cards have been flipped over, or when the user exceeds 23 moves. If the user exceeds 23 moves, they lose the game, which engenders a score of 0,
otherwise, they garner a score between 20, and 65. The highest possible score is 65, since the lowest amount of moves is 8.
